# Utils
 All my solutions to everyday problems.

In here you will find some random stuff, such as scripts, web extensions...
I will post all the useful stuff that doesn't need a repository for itself.

At the moment, I have: 
- Script to export a table from a .sql into a MySQL database

What I'm working on:
- Chrome extension to process your Instagram data about your followers/follows
