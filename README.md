# Utils
 All my solutions to everyday problems.

In here you will find some random stuff, such as scripts, web extensions...
I will post all the useful stuff that doesn't need a repository for itself.

At the moment, I have: 
- Script to export a table from a .sql into a MySQL database
- Configuration files for Traefik (as a reverse-proxy)
- Configuration files for Nginx (proxy)
